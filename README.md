# Predictive Analytics for Smart Agriculture

## Project Overview
RainWise is a machine learning model designed to predict the probability of rain based on historical weather data. The model is intended to support smart agricultural practices by providing accurate, hyper-local weather predictions to help farmers optimize irrigation, planting, and harvesting schedules.

### Key Features
- Predicts rain probability for the next 21 days
- Utilizes historical weather data with features including temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Employs a RandomForestClassifier with hyperparameter tuning to optimize accuracy
- Provides actionable insights for agricultural decision-making

1. *Clone the repository:*
bash
git clone https://github.com/danu2003-cy/Intellihack_CypherZ_Task01.git


2. *Create a virtual environment:*
bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate


3. *Add the dataset:*
Place the dataset (customer_behavior_analytics.csv) in the data directory.

### Running the Project

1. *Run the script:*
bash
python Intellihack_CypherZ_Task01.py


2. *View Results:*
The output file customer_segments_output.csv will be generated in the project directory.
